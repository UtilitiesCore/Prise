Prise is a plugin framework for .NET Core applications, written in .NET Core.
The goal of Prise, is enable you to write **decoupled pieces** of code using the least amount of effort, whilst maximizing the customizability. Prise helps you load plugins from **foreign assemblies**. It is built to decouple the **local** and **remote** dependencies, and strives to avoid assembly mismatches.

Prise features:
- Easy setup
- Eager and Lazy loading of plugins
- Fully customizable loading of plugins
- Loading plugins with their own dependencies
- Loading plugins over the network
- Supporting backwards compatibility for older plugins

# How does Prise work ?
At the heart, Prise uses a **DispatchProxy** of your contract. Every call to a method channels through this proxy and is delegated to the loaded plugin.

Prise **does not require the plugin to implement the interface** provided by the contract, allowing you to extend the contract going forward, whilst still keeping your **old plugins backwards compatible**.
You can customize Prise to fit your needs, examples of this are:
- Loading plugins from over the network
- Loading plugins based on a condition at runtime (Environment Variable)
- Loading multiple plugins and choosing which one fits the purpose for a specific task
- Loading lazily or eagerly
